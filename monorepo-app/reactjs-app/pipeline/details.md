This pipeline configuration sets up a process using Jenkins, a popular automation server. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Agent any**: This line tells Jenkins to run the pipeline on any available agent (a machine that can execute tasks).

2. **Parameters**: This section defines the inputs that users can provide when they run the pipeline.

    - **gitParameter**: This parameter type allows users to choose a branch from a Git repository. 
        - **branchFilter**: It specifies a pattern to filter branches. In this case, it selects branches that start with 'origin/' followed by any characters.
        - **defaultValue**: It sets the default branch if the user doesn't specify one.
        - **name**: It labels the parameter field as 'Branch' in the Jenkins interface.
        - **type**: It specifies the type of parameter, which in this case is a branch selector.


1. **Preparation Stage**: 
    - This stage is named 'Preparation'.
    - Inside this stage, there is a single step defined using the 'sh' command which removes all files and directories ('rm -rf *') in the current directory. This is typically done to clean up any remnants from previous builds.

2. **Cloning the Project Stage**:
    - This stage is named 'Cloning the Project'.
    - Inside this stage, there is a step written in Groovy script.
    - It tries to execute the following actions:
        - It echoes the values of parameters 'Branch' and 'Server' to the console.
        - It uses the 'git' command to clone a repository from a GitHub URL ('https://github.com/devpms/nutriag.nmr.git') based on the values provided for the 'Branch' parameter.
        - The credentials for GitHub access are specified using the 'credentialsId' parameter.
    - If any errors occur during the execution, it catches the exception, echoes the failure message, sets the build result to 'FAILURE', and throws the exception to halt the pipeline execution.



1. **Purpose**: This code is a part of a script or pipeline that is likely used in a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process. It is responsible for removing old code from a server before deploying new updates.

2. **Conditions**: The script checks whether the deployment is targeting the Production server or the Development server.

3. **Actions**:
   - If the deployment is for Production:
     - It connects to a specific server (identified by its IP address) using SSH.
     - It sends a script (`before_update.sh`) to the server.
     - The script on the server navigates to a specific directory (`/var/www/nutriag.nmr`) and removes all files and folders inside it (`rm -rf *`).
   - If the deployment is for Development:
     - It follows similar steps as above but connects to a different server (identified by a different IP address).

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The code is wrapped in a `try` block to catch any exceptions that might occur during the process.
   - If an exception occurs, it prints a failure message, sets the build result to 'FAILURE', and throws the exception.

5. **SSH**: SSH (Secure Shell) is used for secure communication between the machine running the script and the target servers. It allows executing commands on remote servers securely.

There is a stage called "Building the Code" which contains steps for transferring files to different servers based on a parameter called "Server". Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It checks the value of the "Server" parameter.
2. If the server is set to 'Production', it compresses the files into a tarball and transfers them via SSH to a specified AWS server.
3. If the server is set to 'Development', it compresses the files into a tarball and transfers them via SSH to another specified server.
4. If there are any errors during the transfer process, it catches the exception, prints a failure message, marks the build as 'FAILURE', and throws the exception.




1. It checks whether the server specified is for "Production" or "Development".
2. If the server is for Production, it connects to an AWS EC2 instance with a specific IP address via SSH, then it performs a series of commands to update the application environment, install dependencies, run database migrations, and restart the application using PM2.
3. If the server is for Development, it connects to another server (presumably another EC2 instance) via SSH using a different IP address, then it performs similar tasks as in the Production environment but with the development environment configurations.
4. After executing the necessary commands, it prints "One way or another, I have finished" to indicate the completion of the process.
5. If any error occurs during the process, it catches the exception, prints an error message, marks the build as a failure, and throws the exception.
